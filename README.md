# StegOnCrack
StegCracker but actually good
* Automatically runs Steghide with no password no matter what the wordlistt
* Instead of automatically spawning a new terminal everytime, import Steghide and call the code directly
* Use async code because 4 threads of Stegcracker is just so bad especially when it has no IO it's just system commands you could probably do 50k a second attempts
